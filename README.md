This code implements a simple number guessing game. Here's a summary:

1. The program randomly selects a number between 0 and 99.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. If the user's guess matches the randomly selected number, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the game ends.
4. If the guess is too low or too high, a hint is provided, and the user is prompted to guess again.
5. The loop continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
6. Finally, the correct number is displayed.

It's a fun little game to practice Java and get familiar with loops, conditionals, and user input. Ready to test your skills....ðŸ˜‰
